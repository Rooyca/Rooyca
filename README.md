    <h1 align="center">Hi, my name is Rooyca üëã</h1>
</p>

I'm a programmer. I work on a couple of open source projects, but also closed source projects. I work on projects like [Mr. Infinity](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=720321585625694239&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=8&redirect_uri=https://blobs.gq/imanager&prompt=consent&response_type=code), [GCommands](https://github.com/Garlic-Team/GCommands), [Muploader](https://github.com/xHyroM/Muploder), [Roles Bot](https://github.com/xHyroM/roles-bot) and many more.  
I'll be glad if you take a look at my github üòÄüëÄ.
